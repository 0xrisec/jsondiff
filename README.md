## Why Choose this JSONDiff Tool Over Others? ü§î

While there are existing solutions for JSON comparison, I believe there's room for improvement, especially for professional and enterprise-level work. Here's why this JSONDiff Tool stands out:

- **Ad-Free Experience üö´**: Other tools often display intrusive Google ads that can detract from a professional environment, especially during screen-sharing sessions. While we understand the necessity of funding, our tool uses non-intrusive promotions that won't compromise your professional image. Most other tools do not offer an ad-free experience and those that do often fail to provide clear and informative JSON difference messages. The UI has been designed to be simple and focused on delivering meaningful difference messages, avoiding the distraction of Google ads.

- **Handles Dirty JSON üßº**: JSONDiff Tool not only compares but also offers options to clean and fix these JSON structures before comparison. Encountering modified, encoded, or "dirty" JSON is common during development. Most tools lack this feature to fix JSON, setting our tool apart.  

- **Privacy and Security üîí**: Your JSON data is yours alone. Ensure that your data is never shared with anyone and that comparisons are done securely in your browser. Plus, our source code is open-source and deployed on GitHub Pages, allowing you to review the source code for complete transparency.

## Features üåü

- Validate JSON syntax effortlessly.
- Format JSON for readability.
- Compare two JSON documents side-by-side.
- Ad-free, professional-grade tool.

Here's what the JSONdiff fix feature can do for you:

- **Quotes Correction**: Adds or fixes missing quotes around keys.
- **Escape Characters**: Adds or corrects missing escape characters.
- **Comma Handling**: Fixes missing commas and cleans trailing commas.
- **Bracket Closure**: Adds or fixes missing closing brackets.
- **Quote Standardization**: Replaces special quote characters (e.g., ‚Äú...‚Äù) with standard double quotes.
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Replaces special whitespace characters with regular spaces.
- **Boolean and Null Values**: Converts Python constants (`None`, `True`, `False`) to their JSON equivalents (`null`, `true`, `false`).
- **Comment Removal**: Removes comments, including both block (`/* ... */`) and line (`// ...`) comments.
- **JSONP Notation Cleaning**: Cleans JSONP notation (e.g., `callback({...})`).
- **Escaped String Cleaning**: Removes unnecessary escape characters from already escaped strings (e.g., `{\\"stringified\\": \\"content\\"}`).
- **MongoDB Data Type Conversion**: Converts MongoDB data types (e.g., `NumberLong(2)`, `ISODate("2022-03-03T05:02:11.111Z")`) to standard JSON formats.
- **String Concatenation**: Concatenates split strings (e.g., `"longer text" + "more text on next line"`).

By addressing these issues, the fix feature ensures your JSON data is syntactically correct and ready for use in your applications.
